🧮 How It Works
For Car Salary Sacrifice:

Enter your salary and car lease cost
Add car details (P11D value, CO2 emissions, type)
See tax savings - e.g., £15k lease costs only ~£8k net
Plus BiK tax - Still pay tax on car benefit value
Net result - Significant savings, especially for higher earners

Example Savings:

£100k earner leasing £20k/year car
Tax savings: £20k × 48% = £9,600
Net lease cost: £10,400 vs £20k after-tax
Plus BiK tax: ~£2k/year (varies by car)
Total saving: £7,600/year vs buying after-tax!
